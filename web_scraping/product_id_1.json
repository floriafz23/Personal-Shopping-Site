			"review_text": "I’m starting to get the impression that all the best products are the ones NOT heavily talked about cause this foundation is amazing! Initially I wasn’t interested in yet another designer makeup brand but I became just okay with the Gucci foundation & began to start looking  to see if there was something better. Which lead me to Valentino & Prada and Valentino was visibly more superior for “me” Shade match with Valentino is spot on, like I literally can’t even see it it’s just that good & better than any shade I’ve had thus far. Texture is the perfect satin/matte & def full coverage without looking like a mask but still blends beautifully & becomes 1 with your skin. I tested with & without primer and both were good but since I have some texture, the Gucci primer def elevated the finish to perfection. I’m so happy I decided to try this foundation & not just rely on being comfortable with Gucci cause I certainly would have been missing out on finally having a HG foundation that is literally perfect straight out the bottle!"

I love that it has a soft matte finish.   Bit of reflective highlight shimmer in the foundation to give you the perfect finish.   I have dry skin type and found it quite smooth for texture.   It is scented yes, but nothing unbearable as i am sensitive to floral fragrances due to my sinuses.  Will be repurchased again!"

Unfortunately, the perfume is so strong that it made me sneeze, and the scent lasted for several hours.  People around me noticed it.  That amount of perfume is unacceptable. It suggests that there is a ton of alcohol in the product, which is very drying. Valentino should reformulate this without the perfume.  As it is, I cannot wear this foundation"

If you look at the bottle closely you will see pearlescent particles in it, which doesn’t look glittery on face but in fact lends a nice subtle glow. My only gripe is that I bought this directly from Valentino and the store had warm lighting so I chose a shade that was darker than my usual skin tone. And then with time the foundation turns orange too. I wish it didn’t oxidize so much on me. I really like the formula though. I’d probably pick 2 shades lighter next time."
