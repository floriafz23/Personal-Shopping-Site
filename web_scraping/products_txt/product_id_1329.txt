How to Use: Suggested Usage:.Prada fragrances are intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a strong and long-lasting perfume scent. After applying your Eau de Parfum, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly. If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent handwashing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.
