How to Use: Suggested Usage:.-Spritz one to two times directly on the pulse points, such as your wrists, inner elbows, or sides of the neck. Pulse points are warmer areas of the body that act as natural diffusers when emitting a scent..-After application, allow the scent to air dry. Rubbing or dabbing will break down a fragrance and cause it to wear off more quickly..-If you wear fragrance on the wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent handwashing..-Properly store your bottle to extend its shelf life, including recapping after each use and avoiding direct sunlight...Recycling Instructions:.-While Commodity works toward fully recyclable packaging, the majority of your fragrance can currently be recycled. Box, paper notecard, and pulp tray should be recycled as paper. Glass bottle and metal pump should be recycled as glass. Cellophane and bottle cap should be thrown in the trash.
